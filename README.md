# ProceduralWorldGen
My attempt to recreate terraria style world generation in the Odin programming language using Raylib

## Performance
currently I can genereate and render 8400 Ã— 2400 tiles at a solid 60 FPS (I have set this as the max FPS for now) uncapped it runs at around 700 FPS.

It does help that there isnt much going on here yet but I do plan on adding a player character and some basic block placing and destroying. I also hope to get more biomes and  tile types rendering
